Tim McGraw- He said the way my blue eyes shined Put those Georgia stars to shame that night I said: "That's a lie." Just a boy in a Chevy truck That had a tendency of gettin' stuck On back roads at night And I was right there beside him all summer long And then the time we woke up to find that summer had gone But when you think "Tim McGraw" I hope you think my favorite song The one we danced to all night long The moon like a spotlight on the lake When you think happiness I hope you think "that little black dress" Think of my head on your chest And my old faded blue jeans When you think Tim McGraw I hope you think of me September saw a month of tears And thankin' God that you weren't here To see me like that But in a box beneath my bed Is a letter that you never read From three summers back It's hard not to find it all a little bitter sweet And lookin' back on all of that, it's nice to believe But when you think "Tim McGraw" I hope you think my favorite song The one we danced to all night long The moon like a spotlight on the lake When you think happiness I hope you think "that little black dress" Think of my head on your chest And my old faded blue jeans When you think Tim McGraw I hope you think of me And I'm back for the first time since then I'm standin' on your street And there's a letter left on your doorstep And the first thing that you'll read Is when you think "Tim McGraw" I hope you think my favorite song Someday you'll turn your radio on I hope it takes you back to that place When you think happiness I hope you think "that little black dress" Think of my head on your chest And my old faded blue jeans When you think Tim McGraw I hope you think of me Oh, think of me Mmm You said the way my blue eyes shined Put those Georgia stars to shame that night I said, "That's a lie."

Our Song- I was riding shotgun with my hair undone in the front seat of his car, He's got a one-hand feel on the steering wheel, The other on my heart, I look around, turn the radio down, he says, "baby is something wrong?" I say "nothing, I was just thinking how we don't have a song, "  And he says, Our song is a slamming screen door,  Sneaking out late tapping on your window, When we're on the phone and you talk real slow, 'Cause it's late and your mama don't know, Our song is the way you laugh, The first date man I didn't kiss her when I should have, And when I got home, before I said amen, Asking God if He could play it again. I was walking up the front porch steps after everything that day, Had gone all wrong, had been trampled on and lost and thrown away, Got to the hallway well on my way to my lovin' bed, I almost didn't notice all the roses, And the note that said, Our song is a slamming screen door,  Sneaking out late tapping on your window, When we're on the phone and you talk real slow, 'Cause it's late and your mama don't know, Our song is the way you laugh, The first date man I didn't kiss her when I should have, And when I got home, before I said amen, Asking God if He could play it again. I've heard every album, listened to the radio, Waiting for something to come along, That was as good as our song, 'Cause our song is a slamming screen door, Sneaking out late tapping on your window, When we're on the phone, and he talks real slow, 'Cause it's late and his mama don't know, Our song is the way he laughs, The first date man I didn't kiss him when I should have, And when I got home, before I said amen, Asking God if He could play it again. I was riding shotgun with my hair undone in the front seat of his car, I grabbed a pen and an old napkin  And I wrote down our song.

Please tell me 'Cause one second it was perfect, now you're halfway out the door And I stare at the phone, he still hasn't called And then you feel so low you can't feel nothing at all And you flashback to when he said forever and always Oh, and it rains in your bedroom Everything is wrong It rains when you're here and it rains when you're gone 'Cause I was there when you said forever and always Was I out of line? Did I say something way too honest, made you run and hide Like a scared little boy I looked into your eyes Thought I knew you for a minute, now I'm not so sure So here's to everything coming down to nothing Here's to silence, that cuts me to the core Where is this going? Thought I knew for a minute, but I don't anymore And I stare at the phone, he still hasn't called And then you feel so low you can't feel nothing at all And you flashback to when he said forever and always Oh, and it rains in your bedroom Everything is wrong It rains when you're here and it rains when you're gone 'Cause I was there when you said forever and always You didn't mean it baby, I don't think so Oh back up, baby, back up Did you forget everything?

The Best Day- I'm five years old It's getting cold I've got my big coat on I hear your laugh And look up smiling at you I run and run Past the pumpkin patch And the tractor rides Look now, the sky is gold I hug your legs And fall asleep on the way home I don't know why all the trees change in the fall But I know you're not scared of anything at all Don't know if Snow White's house is near or far away But I know I had the best day with you today I'm thirteen now And don't know how My friends could be so mean I come home crying And you hold me tight And grab the keys And we drive and drive Until we find a town far enough away And we talk and window shop 'Till I forgotten all their names I don't know who I'm gonna talk to now at school But I know I'm laughing On the car ride home with you Don't know how long it's gonna take to feel okay But I know I had the best day with you today I have an excellent father His strength is making me stronger God smiles on my little brother Inside and out he's better than I am I grew up in a pretty house And I've got space to run and hide And I had the best days with you There is a video I found From back when I was three You set up a paint set in the kitchen And you're talking to me It's the age of princesses and pirate ships And the seven dwarfs And Daddy's smart And you're the prettiest lady in the whole wide world And now I know why the all the trees change in the fall I know you were on my side Even when I was wrong And I love you for giving me your eyes Staying back and watching me shine And, I didn't know if you knew So I'm taking this chance to say That I had the best day with you today.
Change- And it's a sad picture, the final blow hits you Somebody else gets what you wanted again and You know it's all the same, another time and place Repeating history and you're getting sick of it But I believe in whatever you do And I'll do anything to see it through Because these things will change Can you feel it now? These walls that they put up to hold us back will fall down It's a revolution, the time will come For us to finally win And we'll sing hallelujah, we'll sing hallelujah So we've been outnumbered Raided and now cornered It's hard to fight when the fight ain't fair We're getting stronger now Find things they never found They might be bigger But we're faster and never scared You can walk away, say we don't need this But there's something in your eyes Says we can beat this Because these things will change Can you feel it now? These walls that they put up to hold us back will fall down It's a revolution, the time will come For us to finally win And we'll sing hallelujah, we'll sing hallelujah Tonight we'll stand, get off our knees Fight for what we've worked for all these years And the battle was long, it's the fight of our lives But we'll stand up champions tonight It was the night things changed Can you see it now? These walls that they put up to hold us back fell down It's a revolution, throw your hands up 'Cause we never gave in And we'll sing hallelujah, we sang hallelujah Hallelujah

Mine- Oh, oh, oh Oh, oh, oh You were in college, working part-time, waiting tables Left a small town, never looked back I was a flight risk, with a fear of fallin' Wondering why we bother with love, if it never lasts I say, "Can you believe it?" As we're lyin' on the couch The moment, I can see it Yes, yes, I can see it now Do you remember, we were sittin', there by the water? You put your arm around me for the first time You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter You are the best thing, that's ever been mine Flash forward, and we're takin' on the world together And there's a drawer of my things at your place You learn my secrets and you figure out why I'm guarded You say we'll never make my parents' mistakes And we got bills to pay We got nothin' figured out When it was hard to take Yes, yes This is what I thought about Do you remember, we were sittin' there, by the water? You put your arm around me, for the first time You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter You are the best thing, that's ever been mine Do you remember all the city lights on the water?

And every time I look at you, it's like the first time. I fell in love with a careless man's careful daughter. She is the best thing that's ever been mine."

I haven't seen them in a while You've been good, busier than ever We small talk, work and the weather Your guard is up and I know why Because the last time you saw me Is still burned in the back of your mind You gave me roses and I left them there to die So this is me swallowing my pride Standing in front of you saying I'm sorry for that night And I go back to December all the time It turns out freedom ain't nothing but missing you Wishing I'd realized what I had when you were mine I'd go back to December, turn around and make it all right I go back to December all the time These days I haven't been sleeping Staying up playing back myself leaving When your birthday passed and I didn't call And I think about summer, all the beautiful times I watched you laughing from the passenger side And realized I'd loved you in the fall And then the cold came, the dark days when fear crept into my mind You gave me all your love and all I gave you was goodbye So this is me swallowing my pride Standing in front of you saying I'm sorry for that night And I go back to December all the time It turns out freedom ain't nothing but missing you Wishing I'd realized what I had when you were mine I'd go back to December turn around and change my own mind I go back to December all the time I miss your tan skin, your sweet smile, so good to me, so right And how you held me in your arms that September night The first time you ever saw me cry Maybe this is wishful thinking Probably mindless dreaming But if we loved again I swear I'd love you right I'd go back in time and change it but I can't So if the chain is on your door, I understand But this is me swallowing my pride Standing in front of you saying I'm sorry for that night And I go back to December It turns out freedom ain't nothing but missing you Wishing I'd realized what I had when you were mine I'd go back to December turn around and make it all right I'd go back to December turn around and change my own mind I go back to December all the time all the time
Speak Now- I am not the kind of girl Who should be rudely bargin' in on a white veil occasion But you are not the kind of boy Who should be marryin' the wrong girl I sneak in and see your friends And her snotty little family, all dressed in pastel And she is yelling at a bridesmaid Somewhere back inside a room Wearing a gown shaped like a pastry This is surely not what you thought it would be I lose myself in a daydream Where I stand and say "Don't say yes, run away now I'll meet you when you're out Of the church at the back door Don't wait or say a single vow You need to hear me out" And they said, "speak now" Fond gestures are exchanged And the organ starts to play A song that sounds like a death march And I am hiding in the curtains It seems I was uninvited by your lovely bride-to-be She floats down the aisle like a pageant queen But I know you wish it was me You wish it was me, don't you? Don't say yes, run away now I'll meet you when you're out Of the church at the back door Don't wait or say a single vow You need to hear me out And they said, "speak now" Don't say yes, run away now I'll meet you when you're out Of the church at the back door Don't wait or say a single vow Your time is running out And they said, "speak now" I hear the preacher say "Speak now or forever hold your peace" There's a silence, there's my last chance I stand up with shaking hands All eyes on me Horrified looks from everyone in the room But I'm only lookin' at you I am not the kind of girl Who should be rudely bargin' in on a white veil occasion But you are not the kind of boy, Who should be marryin' the wrong girl So don't say yes, run away now I'll meet you when you're out Of the church at the back door Don't wait or say a single vow You need to hear me out And they said, "speak now" And you say, "let's run away now I'll meet you when I'm out of my tux at the back door Oh baby, I didn't say my vow So glad you were around when they said, "speak now"
Dear John- Long were the nights when my days once revolved around you Counting my footsteps, Praying the floor won't fall through, again My mother accused me of losing my mind, But I swore I was fine, you paint me a blue sky And go back and turn it to rain And I lived in your chess game, But you changed the rules every day Wondering which version of you I might get on the phone Tonight, well I stopped picking up, and this song is to let you know why Dear John, I see it all now that you're gone Don't you think I was too young to be messed with? The girl in the dress, cried the whole way home, I should've known Well maybe it's me and my blind optimism to blame Maybe it's you and your sick need to give love then take it away And you'll add my name to your long list of traitors who don't understand And I'll look back and regret how I ignored when they said "run as fast as you can" Dear John, I see it all now that you're gone Don't you think I was too young to be messed with? The girl in the dress, cried the whole way home Dear John, I see it all, now it was wrong Don't you think nineteen is too young To be played by your dark twisted games, when I loved you so? I should've known You are an expert at sorry, And keeping the lines blurry Never impressed by me acing your tests All the girls that you've run dry Have tired, lifeless eyes 'Cause you burned them out But I took your matches before fire could catch me, So don't look now, I'm shining like fireworks over your sad, empty town Dear John, I see it all now that you're gone Don't you think I was too young to be messed with? The girl in the dress, cried the whole way home. I see it all now that you're gone Don't you think I was too young to be messed with? The girl in the dress wrote you a song You should've known, you should've known Don't you think I was too young? You should've known

All Too Well - I walked through the door with you, the air was cold. But something 'bout it felt like home somehow. And I left my scarf there at your sister's house. And you've still got it in your drawer even now. Oh, your sweet disposition and my wide-eyed gaze. We're singing in the car, getting lost Upstate. Autumn leaves falling down like pieces into place. And I can picture it after all these days. And I know it's long gone. And that magic's not here no more. And I might be okay. But I'm not fine at all. 'Cause there we are again on that little town street. You almost ran the red 'cause you were looking over at me. Wind in my hair, I was there, I remember it all too well. Photo album on the counter, your cheeks were turning red. You used to be a little kid with glasses in a twin sized bed. And your mother's telling stories about you on a tee ball team. You taught me 'bout your past, thinking your future was me. And I know it's long gone. And there was nothing else I could do. And I forget about you long enough. To forget why I needed to.'Cause there we are again in the middle of the night. We're dancing around the kitchen in the refrigerator light. Down the stairs, I was there, I remember it all too well, yeah. Well, maybe we got lost in translation, maybe I asked for too much. But maybe this thing was a masterpiece 'til you tore it all up. Running scared, I was there, I remember it all too well. Hey, you call me up again just to break me like a promise. So casually cruel in the name of being honest. I'm a crumpled up piece of paper lying here. 'Cause I remember it all, all, all... too well. Time won't fly, it's like I'm paralyzed by it, I'd like to be my old self again, but I'm still trying to find it. After plaid shirt days and nights when you made me your own. Now you mail back my things and I walk home alone. But you keep my old scarf from that very first week. 'Cause it reminds you of innocence and it smells like me. You can't get rid of it 'cause you remember it all too well, yeah. 'Cause there we are again, when I loved you so. Back before you lost the one real thing you've ever known. It was rare, I was there, I remember it all too well. Wind in my hair, you were there, you remember it all. Down the stairs, you were there, you remember it all.

this is me trying- I've been having a hard time adjusting I had the shiniest wheels, now they're rusting I didn't know if you'd care if I came back I have a lot of regrets about that Pulled the car off the road to the lookout Could've followed my fears all the way down And maybe I don't quite know what to say But I'm here in your doorway I just wanted you to know that this is me trying I just wanted you to know that this is me trying They told me all of my cages were mental So I got wasted like all my potential And my words shoot to kill when I'm mad I have a lot of regrets about that I was so ahead of the curve, the curve became a sphere Fell behind all my classmates and I ended up here Pouring out my heart to a stranger But I didn't pour the whiskey I just wanted you to know that this is me trying I just wanted you to know that this is me trying At least I'm trying And it's hard to be at a party when I feel like an open wound It's hard to be anywhere these days when all I want is you You're a flashback in a film reel on the one screen in my town And I just wanted you to know that this is me trying (And maybe I don't quite know what to say) I just wanted you to know that this is me trying At least I'm trying
illicit affairs- Make sure nobody sees you leave Hood over your head, keep your eyes down Tell your friends you're out for a run You’ll be flushed when you return Take the road less traveled by Tell yourself you can always stop What started in beautiful rooms Ends with meetings in parking lots And that's the thing about illicit affairs And clandestine meetings and longing stares It's born from just one single glance But it dies and it dies and it dies A million little times Leave the perfume on the shelf That you picked out just for him So you leave no trace behind Like you don’t even exist Take the words for what they are A dwindling, mercurial high A drug that only worked The first few hundred times And that's the thing about illicit affairs And clandestine meetings and stolen stares They show their truth one single time But they lie and they lie and they lie A billion little times And you wanna scream Don't call me "kid," don't call me "baby" Look at this godforsaken mess that you made me You showed me colors you know I can't see with anyone else Don't call me "kid," don't call me "baby" Look at this idiotic fool that you made me You taught me a secret language I can't speak with anyone else And you know damn well For you, I would ruin myself A million little times
invisible string- Green was the color of the grass Where I used to read at Centennial Park I used to think I would meet somebody there Teal was the color of your shirt When you were sixteen at the yogurt shop You used to work at to make a little money Time, curious time Gave me no compasses, gave me no signs Were there clues I didn't see? And isn't it just so pretty to think All along there was some Invisible string Tying you to me? Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh Bad was the blood of the song in the cab On your first trip to LA You ate at my favorite spot for dinner Bold was the waitress on our three-year trip Getting lunch down by the Lakes She said I looked like an American singer Time, mystical time Cutting me open, then healing me fine Were there clues I didn't see? And isn't it just so pretty to think All along there was some Invisible string Tying you to me? Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh A string that pulled me Out of all the wrong arms, right into that dive bar Something wrapped all of my past mistakes in barbed wire Chains around my demons Wool to brave the seasons One single thread of gold Tied me to you Cold was the steel of my axe to grind For the boys who broke my heart Now I send their babies presents Gold was the color of the leaves When I showed you around Centennial Park Hell was the journey but it brought me heaven Time, wondrous time Gave me the blues and then purple-pink skies And it's cool Baby, with me And isn't it just so pretty to think All along there was some Invisible string Tying you to me? Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh Me Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh (Ah-ah-ah) (Ah-ah-ah)

hoax- My only one My smoking gun My eclipsed sun This has broken me down My twisted knife My sleepless night My winless fight This has frozen my ground Stood on the cliffside screaming, "Give me a reason" Your faithless love's the only hoax I believe in Don't want no other shade of blue but you No other sadness in the world would do My best laid plan Your sleight of hand My barren land I am ash from your fire Stood on the cliffside screaming, "Give me a reason" Your faithless love's the only hoax I believe in Don't want no other shade of blue but you No other sadness in the world would do You know I left a part of me back in New York You knew the hero died so what's the movie for? You knew it still hurts underneath my scars From when they pulled me apart You knew the password so I let you in the door You knew you won so what's the point of keeping score? You knew it still hurts underneath my scars From when they pulled me apart But what you did was just as dark (Ah, ah, ah) Darling, this was just as hard As when they pulled me apart My only one My kingdom come undone My broken drum You have beaten my heart Don't want no other shade of blue but you No other sadness in the world would do
deluxe version
the lakes- Is it romantic how all my elegies eulogize me? I'm not cut out for all these cynical clones These hunters with cell phones Take me to the Lakes where all the poets went to die I don't belong and, my beloved, neither do you Those Windermere peaks look like a perfect place to cry I'm setting off, but not without my muse What should be over burrowed under my skin In heart-stopping waves of hurt I've come too far to watch some namedropping sleaze Tell me what are my words worth Take me to the Lakes where all the poets went to die I don't belong and, my beloved, neither do you Those Windermere peaks look like a perfect place to cry I'm setting off, but not without my muse I want auroras and sad prose I want to watch wisteria grow right over my bare feet 'Cause I haven't moved in years And I want you right here A red rose grew up out of ice frozen ground With no one around to tweet it While I bathe in cliffside pools With my calamitous love and insurmountable grief Take me to the Lakes where all the poets went to die I don't belong and, my beloved, neither do you Those Windermere peaks look like a perfect place to cry I'm setting off, but not without my muse No, not without you

champagne problems- You booked the night train for a reason So you could sit there in this hurt Bustling crowds or silent sleepers You're not sure which is worse Because I dropped your hand while dancing Left you out there standing Crestfallen on the landing Champagne problems Your mom's ring in your pocket My picture in your wallet Your heart was glass, I dropped it Champagne problems You told your family for a reason You couldn't keep it in Your sister splashed out on the bottle Now no one's celebrating Dom Pérignon, you brought it No crowd of friends applauded Your hometown skeptics called it Champagne problems You had a speech, you're speechless Love slipped beyond your reaches And I couldn't give a reason Champagne problems Your Midas touch on the Chevy door November flush and your flannel cure "This dorm was once a madhouse" I made a joke, "Well, it's made for me" How evergreen, our group of friends Don't think we'll say that word again And soon they'll have the nerve to deck the halls That we once walked through One for the money, two for the show I never was ready so I watch you go Sometimes you just don't know the answer 'Til someone's on their knees and asks you "She would've made such a lovely bride What a shame she's fucked in the head," they said But you'll find the real thing instead She'll patch up your tapestry that I shred And hold your hand while dancing Never leave you standing Crestfallen on the landing With champagne problems Your mom's ring in your pocket Her picture in your wallet You won't remember all my Champagne problems You won't remember all my Champagne problems

coney island (feat. The National)- Break my soul in two looking for you But you're right here If I can't relate to you anymore Then who am I related to? And if this is the long haul How'd we get here so soon? Did I close my fist around something delicate? Did I shatter you? And I'm sitting on a bench in Coney Island Wondering where did my baby go? The fast times, the bright lights, the merry go Sorry for not making you my centerfold Over and over Lost again with no surprises Disappointments, close your eyes And it gets colder and colder When the sun goes down The question pounds my head What's a lifetime of achievement If I pushed you to the edge? But you were too polite to leave me And do you miss the rogue Who coaxed you into paradise and left you there? Will you forgive my soul When you're too wise to trust me and too old to care? 'Cause we were like the mall before the internet It was the one place to be The mischief, the gift-wrapped suburban dreams Sorry for not winning you an arcade ring Over and over Lost again with no surprises Disappointments, close your eyes And it gets colder and colder When the sun goes down Were you waiting at our old spot In the tree line By the gold clock Did I leave you hanging every single day? Were you standing in the hallway With a big cake, happy birthday Did I paint your bluest skies the darkest grey A universe away And when I got into the accident The sight that flashed before me was your face But when I walked up to the podium I think that I forgot to say your name I'm on a bench in Coney Island Wondering where did my baby go The fast times, the bright lights, the merry go Sorry for not making you my centerfold Over and over Lost again with no surprises Disappointments, close your eyes And it gets colder and colder When the sun goes down When the sun goes down The sight that flashed before me was your face When the sun goes down But I think that I forgot to say your name Over and over Sorry for not making you my, making you my Making you my centerfold

Maren Morris) (Taylor’s Version) (From The Vault) - Once the last drop of rain has dried off the pavement Shouldn't I find a stain, but I never do The way the tires turn stones on old county roads They leave it muddy underneath, reminds me of you You find graffiti on the walls of old bathroom stalls You know, you can scratch it right off, it's how it used to be But like the dollar in your pocket, it's been spent and traded in You can't change where it's been, reminds me of me I lived, and I learned, had you, got burned Held out, and held on God knows, too long, and wasted time Lost tears, swore that I'd get out of here But no amount of freedom gets you clean I've still got you all over me The best and worst day of June Was the one that I met you With your hands in your pockets And your "Don't you wish you had me?" grin But I did, so I smiled And I melted like a child Now every breath of air I breathe reminds me of then And I lived, and I learned, had you, got burned Held out, and held on God knows, too long, and wasted time Lost tears, swore that I'd get out of here But no amount of freedom gets you clean I've still got you all over me I lived, and I learned And found out what it was to turn around And see that we Were never really meant to be So I lied, and I cried And I watched a part of myself die 'Cause no amount of freedom gets you clean I've still got you all over me I've still got you all over me Still got you all over me

Beautiful Ghosts- Follow me home if you dare to I wouldn't know where to lead you Should I take chances when no one took chances on me? So I watch from the dark, wait for my life to start With no beauty in my memory All that I wanted was to be wanted Too young to wander London streets, alone and haunted Born into nothing At least you have something Something to cling to Visions of dazzling rooms I'll never get let into And the memories were lost long ago But at least you have beautiful ghosts Perilous night, their voices calling A flicker of light before the dawning Out here, the wild ones are taming the fear within me Scared to call them my friends and be broken again Is this hope just a mystical dream? All that I wanted was to be wanted Too young to wander London streets, alone and haunted Born into nothing At least you have something Something to cling to Visions of dazzling rooms I'll never get let into And the memories were lost long ago But at least you have beautiful ghosts And so maybe my home isn't what I had known What I thought it would be But I feel so alive with these phantoms of night And I know that this life isn't safe but it's wild and it's free All that I wanted was to be wanted I'll never wander London streets alone and haunted Born into nothing With them I have something Something to cling to I never knew I'd love this world they've let me into And the memories were lost long ago So I'll dance with these beautiful ghosts And the memories were lost long ago So I'll dance with these beautiful ghosts
Both of Us- I wish I was strong enough to lift not one but both of us Some day I will be strong enough to lift not one but both of us Ever thought about losing it When your money's all gone and you lose your whip You might lose your grip when the landlord tell ya that you're due for rent And the grass so green on the other side Make a n**** wanna run straight through the fence Open up the fridge bout twenty times But still can't find no food in it That's foolishness And sometimes I wonder, why we care so much about the way we look And the way we talk and the way we act And the clothes we bought, how much that cost? Does it even really matter? 'Cause if life is an uphill battle We all tryna climb with the same ol' ladder In the same boat, with the same ol' paddle Why so shallow? I'm just asking What's the pattern for the madness Everybody ain't a number one draft pick Most of us ain't Hollywood actors But if it's all for one, and one for all Then maybe one day, we all can ball Do it one time for the underdogs Sincerely yours, from one of y'all I wish I was strong enough to lift not one but both of us Some day I will be strong enough to lift not one but both of us I can feel your pain, I can feel your struggle You just wanna live, been everything so low That you could drown in a puddle That's why I gotta hold us up, yeah hold us up For all the times no one's ever spoke for us To every single time that they play this song You can say that that's what Bobby Ray wrote for us When the tides get too high And the sea up underneath get so deep And you feel like you're just another person Getting lost in the crowd, way up high in the nosebleed Uh, because we won't be near yet, both of us But we still stand tall with our shoulders up And even though we always against the odds These are the things that have molded us And if life hadn't chosen us Sometimes I wonder where I would've wound up 'Cause if it was up to me, I'd make a new blueprint Then build it from the ground up, hey But if it's all for one, and one for all Then maybe one day, we all can ball Do it one time for the underdogs From Bobby Ray, to all of y'all I wish I was strong enough to lift not one but both of us Some day I will be strong enough to lift not one but both of us
Christmas Must Be Something More- What if ribbons and bows didn't mean a thing Would the song still survive without five golden rings Would you still wanna kiss without mistletoe What would happen if God never let it snow What would happen if Christmas carols told a lie Tell me what would you find You'd see that today holds something special Something holy, not superficial So here's to the birthday boy who saved our lives It's something we all try to ignore And put a wreath up on your door So here's something you should know that is for sure Christmas must be something more What if angels did not pay attention to All the things that we wished they would always do What if happiness came in a cardboard box Then I think there is something we all forgot What would happen if presents all went away Tell me what would you find You'd see that today holds something special Something holy, not superficial So here's to the birthday boy who saved our lives It's something we all try to ignore And put a wreath up on your door So here's something you should know that is for sure Christmas must be something more We get so caught up in all of it Business and relationships Hundred mile an hour lives And it's this time of year And everybody's here It seems the last thing on your mind Is that the day holds something special Something holy, not superficial So here's to Jesus Christ who saved our lives It's something we all try to ignore And put a wreath up on your door But here's something you should know that is for sure Christmas must be something Christmas must be something Christmas must be something more There's gotta be more There's gotta be more
Christmas Tree Farm- My winter nights are taken up by static Stress, and holiday shopping traffic But I close my eyes, and I'm somewhere else Just like magic In my heart is a Christmas tree farm Where the people would come To dance under sparkling lights Bundled up in their mittens and coats And the cider would flow And I just wanna be there tonight Sweet dreams of holly and ribbon Mistakes are forgiven And everything is icy and blue And you would be there too Under the mistletoe Watching the fire glow And telling me, "I love you" Just being in your arms Takes me back to that little farm Where every wish comes true In my heart is a Christmas tree farm There's a light in the barn We'd run inside out from the cold In the town, kids are dreaming of sleighs And they're warm and they're safe They wake to see a blanket of snow Sweet dreams of holly and ribbon Mistakes are forgiven And everything is icy and blue And you would be there too Under the mistletoe Watching the fire glow And telling me, "I love you" Just being in your arms Takes me back to that little farm Where every wish comes true (Baby, yeah!) And when I'm feeling alone You remind me of home Oh baby, baby, Merry Christmas And when the world isn't fair I'll pretend that we're there Baby, baby, Merry Christmas To you Under the mistletoe (To you) Watching the fire glow And telling me, "I love you" Baby, baby, Merry Christmas Oh baby, baby, Merry Christmas (Darling) Baby, baby, Merry Christmas I love you Oh baby, baby, Merry Christmas Oh baby, baby, Merry Christmas Oh baby, baby, Merry Christmas May your every wish come true 
Christmases When You Were Mine- Please take down the mistletoe 'Cause I don't wanna think about that right now 'Cause everything I want is miles away Snow covered little town My momma's in the kitchen, worrying about me Season's greetings, hope you're well Well I'm doing alright If you were wondering Lately I can never tell I know this shouldn't be a lonely time But there were Christmases when you were mine I've been doing fine without you, really Up until the nights got cold And everybody's here, except you, baby Seems like everyone's got someone to hold But for me it's just a lonely time 'Cause there were Christmases when you were mine Merry Christmas everybody That'll have to be something I just say this year I'll bet you got your mom another sweater And were your cousins late again When you were putting up the lights this year Did you notice one less pair of hands I know this shouldn't be a lonely time But there were Christmases when I didn't wonder how you are tonight 'Cause there were Christmases when you were mine You were mine
Crazier- I've never gone with the wind, just let it flow Let it take me where it wants 'Til you opened the door, there's so much more I've never seen it before I was trying to fly but I couldn't find wings But you came along and you changed everything You lift my feet off the ground You spin me around You make me crazier crazier Feels like I'm falling and I'm lost in your eyes You make me crazier crazier crazier I watched from a distance as you made life your own Every sky was your own kind of blue And I wanted to know how that would feel And you made it so real You showed me something that I couldn't see You opened my eyes and you made me believe. You lift my feet off the ground You spin me around You make me crazier crazier Feels like I'm falling and I'm lost in your eyes You make me crazier, crazier, crazier oh Baby you showed me what livin' is for I don't wanna hide anymore You lift my feet off the ground You spin me around You make me crazier crazier Feels like I'm falling and I'm, I'm lost in your eyes You make me crazier, crazier, crazier Crazier, crazier
Eyes Open- Everybody's waiting Everybody's watching Even when you're sleeping Keep your ey-eyes open The tricky thing Is yesterday we were just children Playing soldiers just pretending Dreaming dreams with happy endings In backyards, winning battles with our wooden swords But now we've stepped into a cruel world Where everybody stands and keeps score Keep your eyes open Everybody's waiting for you to breakdown Everybody's watching to see the fallout Even when you're sleeping, sleeping Keep your ey-eyes open Keep your ey-eyes open Keep your ey-eyes open So here you are, two steps ahead and staying on guard Every lesson forms a new scar They never thought you'd make it this far But turn around (turn around), oh they've surrounded you It's a showdown (showdown) and nobody comes to save you now But you've got something they don't Yeah you've got something they don't You've just gotta keep your eyes open Everybody's waiting for you to breakdown Everybody's watching to see the fallout Even when you're sleeping, sleeping Keep your ey-eyes open Keep your ey-eyes open Keep your ey-eyes Keep your feet ready Heartbeat steady Keep your eyes open Keep your aim locked The night goes dark Keep your eyes open (keep your eyes open) Everybody's waiting for you to breakdown Everybody's watching to see the fallout Even when you're sleeping, sleeping Keep your ey-eyes open Keep your ey-eyes open Keep your ey-eyes open Keep your ey-eyes open Keep your ey-eyes open
Half of My Heart- I was born in the arms of imaginary friends Free to roam, made a home out of everywhere I've been Then you come crashing in, like the realest thing Trying my best to understand all that your love can bring Oh half of my heart's got a grip on the situation Half of my heart takes time Half of my heart's got a right mind to tell you That I can't keep loving you (can't keep loving you) Oh, with half of my heart I was made to believe I'd never love somebody else I made a plan, stay the man who can only love himself Lonely was the song I sang, 'till the day you came Showing me a another way and all that my love can bring Oh half of my heart's got a grip on the situation Half of my heart takes time Half of my heart's got a right mind to tell you That I can't keep loving you (can't keep loving you) Oh, with half of my heart With half of my heart Your faith is strong But I can only fall short for so long Down the road, later on You will hate that I never gave more to you than half of my heart But I can't stop loving you (I can't stop loving you) I can't stop loving you (I can't stop loving you) I can't stop loving you with half of my Half of my heart Oh, half of my heart Half of my heart's got a real good imagination Half of my heart's got you Half of my heart's got a right mind to tell you That half of my heart won't do Half of my heart is a shotgun wedding To a bride with a paper ring And half of my heart is the part of a man Who's never truly loved anything Half of my heart Oh, half of my heart Half of my heart Oh, half of my heart Half of my heart Oh, half of my heart

Macavity- Macavity's a mystery cat, he's called the Hiddenpaw For he's the master criminal who can defy the law He's the bafflement of Scotland Yard, the Flying Squad's despair For when they reach the scene of crime, Macavity's not there Macavity, Macavity, there's no one like Macavity He's broken every human law, he breaks the law of gravity His powers of levitation would make a fakir stare But when they reach the scene of crime, Macavity's not there Macavity's a ginger cat, he's very tall and thin You would know him if you saw him for his eyes are sunken in His brow is deeply lined with thought, his head is highly domed His coat is dusty from neglect, his whiskers are uncombed He sways his head from side to side, with movements like a snake And when you think he's half asleep, he's always wide awake Macavity, Macavity, there's no one like Macavity For he's a fiend in feline shape, a monster of depravity You may meet him in a by-street, you may see him in the square But when a crime's discovered, then Macavity's not there He's outwardly respectable, I know, he cheats at cards And his footprints are not found in any files of Scotland Yard's And when the larder's looted and the jewel case is rifled Or when the milk is missing or another peke's been stifled Or the greenhouse glass is broken and the trellis past repair There's the wonder of the thing, Macavity's not there Macavity, Macavity, there's no one like Macavity There never was a cat of such deceitfulness and suavity He always has an alibi, and one or two to spare What ever time the deed took place, Macavity wasn't there And they say that all the cats whose wicked deeds are widely known I might mention Mungojerrie, Rumpleteazer, Griddlebone Are nothing more than agents for the cat who all the time Just controls the operations, the Napoleon of Crime Macavity, Macavity, there's no one like Macavity He's a fiend in feline shape, a monster of depravity You may meet him in a by-street, you may see him in the square But when a crime's discovered, then Macavity, Macavity Macavity, Macavity When a crime's discovered, then Macavity's not there

Ronan- I remember your bare feet down the hallway I remember your little laugh Race cars on the kitchen floor Plastic dinosaurs, I love you to the moon and back I remember your blue eyes looking into mine like we had our own secret club I remember you dancing before bed time then jumping on me waking me up I can still feel you hold my hand Little man, from even that moment I knew You fought it hard like an army guy Remember I leaned in and whispered to you Come on baby with me We're gonna fly away from here You were my best four years I remember the drive home when the blind hope Turned to crying and screaming, "Why?" Flowers piled up in the worst way No one knows what to say about a beautiful boy who died And it's about to be Halloween You could be anything you wanted if you were still here I remember the last day when I kissed your face I whispered in your ear Come on baby with me We're gonna fly away from here Out of this curtained room in this hospital We'll just disappear Come on baby with me We're gonna fly away from here You were my best four years What if I'm standing in your closet trying to talk to you? What if I kept the hand me downs you won't grow into? And what if I really thought some miracle would see us through? But what if the miracle was even getting one moment with you Come on baby with me We're gonna fly away from here Come on baby with me We're gonna fly away from here You were my best four years I remember your bare feet down the hallway I love you to the moon and back
